# Deep Learning Notebooks

Welcome to my repository, where I share some of my practical deep-learning ideas and concepts. Below, you'll find descriptions of the notebooks included in this repository:

- **Tiger Recognition using Fast.ai:**
  In this notebook, I leverage the Fast.ai library to fine-tune a Resnet18 model for the task of recognizing images of tigers and forests.

- **Semantic Search using Nearest Neighbors vs. Approximate Nearest Neighbors:**
  This notebook offers a detailed comparison of the computational cost of Nearest Neighbors (NN) algorithms for semantic searching. This notebook explores the algorithms that lie at the heart of modern Vector Databases (ANN).
