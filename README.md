# DeepLearning notebooks
This repository includes some of my practical deep-learning ideas and concepts. The notebook Descriptions are as follows:

**Tiger Recognition using Fast.ai:** Uses the Fast.ai library to finetune a Resnet18 model to recognize images of tigers and forests.

**Semantic search using Nearest Neighbours vs approximate nearest Neighbours:** Compares the computational cost of NN and Apprx-NN algorithms for semantic searching
